### [Startpage](https://the-awesome-domogami-site.netlify.app/startpage)

I created a startpage that I use as my web browser homepage and new tab default page. It contains quick links and categories in a way that is consistent with my theme. I also display the date and time at the bottom to give me an idea of how long I've been at my computer.
